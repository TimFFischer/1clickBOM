# 1clickBOM #

#### _Paste to your electronic component shopping carts._ ####

1clickBOM is a browser extension which lets you automatically fill your
electronic component shopping carts at online retailers such as Digikey, Mouser
and Farnell; when you feed it correctly formatted TSV (tab seperated values).
This allows you to simply paste data from a spreadsheet or share a TSV file
with others.

## Which browsers? Which retailers? ##

For the time being the plugin is non-functional until we hit v0.1

Check the [roadmap][1] for planned support.

## Usage ##

### TSV Format ###

The format is compatible with the clip-board format of all major spreadsheet
programs. The tab character is used as a delimiter and values need not be
quoted. One line per component type should be ordered as follows:

    comment | quantity | vendor | part-number

Where ` | ` represents a tab character. The comment would usually be the
component references in your schematic and will be added as a note to your
shopping cart item where possible. See the [example tsv][2].

Eventually 1clickBOM will support multiple vendors per item which can be tacked
on to the end. For the time being the extra vendors will simply be ignored and
only the first vendor and part-number per line will be used.

    comment | quantity | vendor | part-number | vendor2 | part-number2 | vendor3 | ...

## Development ##

### Build and Test Requirements ###

1clickBOM is written in [Coffeescript][4] which transpiles to Javascript.
Currently development is done on Chromium and will later be ported to Firefox.

### Build and Test Instructions ###

To transpile the coffeescript to javascript run `cake build` the chrome
directory. Run `cake` with no arguments for help. The code can then be loaded
as an unpacked extension in the developer mode in Chrome/Chromium settings.

Unit and integration tests are written using the [QUnit framework][5]. Tests
can be run by opening a javascript console on the background page and executing
the `Test()` function.
