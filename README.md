1-click BOM is a browser extension that fills your shopping carts for you on
sites like Digikey and Mouser, you simply paste from a spreadsheet or visit an
online `.tsv` file. This way you can keep one bill of materials (BOM) that lets
you and people you share the BOM with quickly purchase items from multiple
retailers.

## Usage ##

### Adding Items ###

In your tab-seperated values (`.tsv`) or spreadsheet you must have a column for
line-note, one for the quantity and at least one retailer. Column titles are
interpreted in the following way by 1clickBOM. Capitalisation is ignored.

     reference  = line-note
     references = line-note
     line-note  = line-note
     line note  = line-note
     comment    = line-note
     comments   = line-note
     qty        = quantity
     quantity   = quantity
     farnell    = Farnell
     digikey    = Digikey
     digi-key   = Digikey
     mouser     = Mouser
     rs         = RS
     newark     = Newark

![Load from page][3]

If you visit a page that ends in `.tsv` and has data in the right format
available 1clickBOM will show a blue badge and button with an arrow. Clicking
the blue button will load the data into 1clickBOM.  Alternatively you can paste
from any spreadsheet (Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, etc.) by selecting the
relevant columns copying them and then clicking the paste button on 1clickBOM's
popup.

See the [example tsv][2] and the [Bus Pirate tsv][21].

### Let's go shopping! ###

Once the data is added you can use 1clickBOM to add the items to your carts
using the buttons on the popup. You can also quickly view and empty your carts.

### Legacy BOM format ###

The format used prior to version `0.3` simply had the items in the following order:

    line-note | quantity | retailer | part-number

This format is still supported but deprecated and will be phased out by version
`1.0`.

## Development ##

### Build and Test Requirements ###

The code is available on [GitHub][7]. To get started you will need:

- Chrome or Chromium
- Firefox (optionally with [Extension Autoinstaller][16])
- [Mozilla Add-on SDK][18] (cfx)
- GNU Make
- sed
- npm

The rest of the dependencies can be retrieved via `npm install`.

### Build and Test Instructions ###

#### Build

- Get dependencies above and make sure executables are on your path
- `npm install --global` (or `npm install && export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/node_modules/.bin`)
- `make`

#### Load

- For Chrome enable developer mode in `chrome://extensions` and load the unpacked extension from `build/chrome`
- For Firefox run `make run-firefox` (or setup [Autoinstaller][16] and run `make load-firefox`)

#### Test

Tests are written in [QUnit 1.11][17] and can only be run in Chrome/Chromium.
Open a console on background page and execute `Test()` or test a specific
module, e.g.  Farnell, with `Test('Farnell')`

Most of the tests are functional tests that require interaction with the
various retailer sites and they make a lot of network requests to test across
all the different possible locations. Sometimes they will fail because they are
not an accurate representation of actual extension use. If a test fails or
doesn't complete, run it again before investigating. Try and re-create the
issue manually before trying to fix it.
