# 1-click BOM #
####_Automatically populate your electronic component shopping carts._####
1-click BOM is a browser extension which fills your electronic component shopping carts, at online retailers such as Digikey, Mouser and Farnell, when you feed it correctly formatted tab-seperated-values (TSV). This allows you to simply paste data from your bill of materials (BOM) spreadsheet or share a TSV file so others can make the same order locally.

## Which browsers? Which retailers?##

For the time being the plugin is non-functional until we hit v0.0.1

Check the [roadmap](#roadmap) for planned support.

## Usage ##

### TSV Format ###
The format will remain compatible with the clip-board TSV format of all major spreadsheet programs. The tab character is used as a delimiter and values need not be quoted. One line per component type should be ordered as follows:

    comment | quantity | vendor | part-number

Where ``` | ``` represents a tab character. The comment would usually be the component references in your schematic and will be added as a note to your shopping cart item where possible.
See the example [nomech_mini-0.1-BOM.tsv](https://github.com/kasbah/1clickBOM/blob/master/nomech_mini-0.1-BOM.tsv) which is from one of my projects.

Eventually 1-click BOM will support multiple vendors per item which can be tacked on to the end. For the time being the extra vendors will simply be ignored and only the first vendor and part-number per line will be used.

    comment | quantity | vendor | part-number | vendor2 | part-number2 | vendor3 | ...
